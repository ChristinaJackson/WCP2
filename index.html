            <h3>We provide:</h3>   
                    <p>Countertop distillers for personal, in-home use are the most effective way to
                            purify water and eliminates the use of plastic water bottles. </p>
                    <p>They provide the convenience of having clean water in your own home, especially for those
                            that cannot travel to clean water.</p>
                    <p>Distillers remove contaminants from water including heavy metals like lead and copper
                         and distills abour 4 -8 gallons of pure, clean drinking water per day</p>

            <ul>
                <li>25% or more of the water used can come from the tap, samples can contain phthalates, mold,
                        microbes, benzene, trihalomethanes, even arsenic.</li>
                <li>Plastic bottles contain BPAs (all water bottles do regardless of the label) 
                    and when exposed to the sun, the plastic can leak into the water. BPAs can cause
                     endocrine disruptors which can cause over stimulation of naturally occurring hormones
                    in the body. </li>
                <li>Most of the time plastic bottles are not recycled. The plastic can end up 
                    in our oceans and water sources, contaminating them as well. </li>

        <h2 class="">FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Do you make any profit from my donation?</h3>
        <div class = questionAnswer>
            <p>We do not take a profit on any donations. We aim to empower disenfranchised communities and to provide any additional services to help repair their communities</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Why can't you use store bought water filters or bottled water?</h2>
        <div class='questionAnswer'>
            <p>We strongly advise avoiding the use of water bottles because the water used can contain contaminates. 25% of water
                 used are permitted to come from tap water. Also, plastic contaminates water, regardless if itâ€™s stored in a cold 
                 and hot area, and those contaminates can be lethal. Unfortunately, water filters do not remove all toxins 
                 including lead and other heavy metals.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>What can lead cause?</h2>
        <div class ="questionAnswer">
            <p>Lead can cause hypertension, in small doses, and kidney aliments, and, miscarriages, low-birth weight infants, and cognitive deficits which can
                 lead to behavioral issues in high doses. No amount of lead is safe! </p>

        <h2>About Us:</h2>
            <p> I'm Louis Williams. Long ago, sometime around the 1980s, a friend of mine was studying civil engineering and we were discussing 
                how water infrastructure in most American cities have old systems. The pipe were laid in early century and were made of lead. 
                We knew then that lead was dangerous to ingest at any level.</p>
            <p> I started to buy 5 gallon bottles of filtered water, but it did not take me long to figure out with human error I was still taking 
                a risk by purchasing filtered water as I learned most filters failed to clean water efficiently.</p>
            <p> It made sense to me that I can feel safe about distilled water that I processed myself because I'm the only one who can make 
                sure of what I'm drinking is safe. Also, having the convenience of not lugging five gallon bottles is great!</p>
            <p>My niece, Anura, and I saw this was another idea that would aid the folks in Flint to have a little more control of their lives. 
                We want people to know that we are still watching and we care. We have not forgotten about Flint.</p> 
            <p>Keep goin' Flint,<br >Louis and Anura </p>
