        <h2>Our mission:</h2>
            <p>The Water Crisis Project puts the power back into people's hands by teaching people how to purify their own water
                 and providing the resources necessary to do so.</p>
            <p>We hope to help as many families as possible and especially those who are immobile and unable get to clean water sources.</p>

            <p>The people of Flint are not only suffering from the devastation from the water crisis but they have the highest 
                    water bills. The city has been
                     shutting off residents' water for not paying for poisoned water.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It's the most effective way to purify water and eliminates the use of plastic water bottles. </li>
                <li>25% or more of the water used can come from the tap, samples can contain phthalates, mold,
                        microbes, benzene, trihalomethanes, even arsenic.</li>
                <li>Plastic bottles are not recycled, most of the time. The plastic can end up in our oceans and water sources, 
                                contaminating them as well. </li>

        <h2>Why are donations important?</h2>
        <p>Aid is inconsistent; some don't qualify for aid. Some travel out of the city, 
            regardless of transportation restrictions, 
            just to get water bottles. Some wait hours in line just to be turned away.</p>

            <h3>Do you make any profit from my donation?</h3>
            <i class="fa fa-hand-heart">here</i>
            <p>We do not take a profit on any donations. We aim to empower disenfranchised communities and to provide any additional services to help repair their communities</p>

        <div class='question'>
            <h3>Why can't you use store bought water filters or bottled water?</h2>
            <p>We strongly advise avoiding the use of water bottles because the water used can contain contaminates. 25% of water
                 used are permitted to come from tap water. Also, plastic contaminates water, regardless if itâ€™s stored in a cold 
                 and hot area, and those contaminates can be lethal. Unfortunately, water filters do not remove all toxins 
                 including lead and other heavy metals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class ="question">
            <h3>What can lead cause?</h2>
            <p>Lead can cause hypertension, in small doses, and kidney aliments, and, miscarriages, low-birth weight infants, and cognitive deficits which can
                 lead to behavioral issues in high doses. No amount of lead is safe! </p>

        <h2>About Us:</h2>
            <p> I'm Louis Williams. Long ago, sometime around the 1980s, a friend of mine was studying civil engineering and we were discussing 
                how water infrastructure in most American cities have old systems. The pipe were laid in early century and were made of lead. 
                We knew then that lead was dangerous to ingest at any level.</p>
            <p> I started to buy 5 gallon bottles of filtered water, but it did not take me long to figure out with human error I was still taking 
                a risk by purchasing filtered water as I learned most filters failed to clean water efficiently.</p>
            <p> It made sense to me that I can feel safe about distilled water that I processed myself because I'm the only one who can make 
                sure of what I'm drinking is safe. Also, having the convenience of not lugging five gallon bottles is great!</p>
            <p>My niece, Anura, and I saw this was another idea that would aid the folks in Flint to have a little more control of their lives. 
                We want people to know that we are still watching and we care. We have not forgotten about Flint.</p> 
            <p>Keep goin' Flint,<br >Louis and Anura </p>
